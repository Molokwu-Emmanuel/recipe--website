        <ol>
            <li type="number"><b>Beat the eggs:</b>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
            <li type="number"><b>Heat the pan:</b>Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
            <li type="number"><b>Cook the omelette:</b>Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
            <li type="number"><b>Add fillings (optional):</b>When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li type="number"><b>Fold and serve:</b>As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
            <li type="number"><b>Enjoy:</b>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
